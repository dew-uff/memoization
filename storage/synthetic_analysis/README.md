# Storage - Synthetic Analysis

## Run Simulation

To reproduce the synthetic analysis presented in the article, execute the following commands:

```bash
cd scripts/
python persist_storage_script.py
python restore_storage_script.py
```

This will generate the following files:
- **persist_storage_script_log.txt**: Contains the results for the store operation simulation.
- **restore_storage_script_log.txt**: Contains the results for the load operation simulation.

The Python scripts automatically run the simulation 10 times, but only the median execution time is saved in the output files.

## Viewing All Data on a Table Style

The files generated by the simulation can be extensive and difficult to interpret. To display the results in a structured table format, execute:

```bash
cd util_scripts/
bash map_log_file_2_table_file.py SIMULATION_RESULTS.txt TABLE_VIEW.txt
```

## Article Results

The results used in our article are available in the **results/** folder.
