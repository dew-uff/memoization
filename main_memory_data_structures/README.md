# Main Memory Data Structure Analysis

This folder contains information on how to reproduce the main memory data structure analysis performed on the article. Please, note that the four strategies described on the article has a different notation on our implementation, acoording to the following table:

|      Article Notation     | Implementation Notation |
|:-------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| 0-hash-table              |            0            |
| 1-hash-table              |            1            |
| 2-disjoint-hash-tables    |            2            |
