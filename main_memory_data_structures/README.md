# Main Memory Data Structure Analysis

This folder contains all resources required to reproduce the main memory data structure analysis presented in the article. Please note that the four strategies described in the article have different notations in our implementation, as outlined in the table below:

|      Article Notation     | Implementation Notation |
|:-------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| 0-hash-table              |            0            |
| 1-hash-table              |            1            |
| 2-disjoint-hash-tables    |            2            |
| 2-overlapping-hash-tables |          2-fast         |
